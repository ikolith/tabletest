The framework for setting a DC for a given social roll and the framework for reputation management are the same and they can be used in combination. Both systems share the same table of scores with rough characterizations of what each score "feels" like.

The scores range from -6 ("Reviled") to +6 ("Revered"). These scores can be used by a DM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 ("Strongly Disliked") with some group or individual, you treat their social roll as lowered by 2 (or you can just raise the DC by 2).  

You can use these scores to set a sort of "default" attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 ("Well-Liked"). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 ("Strongly Disliked"). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they're going might be at -1 ("Disliked") just because they really don't want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 ("Liked").  

The purpose of social rolls is to be able to, in a given interaction, change the way people perceive you or interact with you. Remember that rolling checks with the SOCIAL score does not replace the content of what a character does but just augments it. If a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, you can treat the interaction as being at 2 points higher than it would be otherwise.  

Say a player character is in a town in which they are at
