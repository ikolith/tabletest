d the DM sets a death DC by rolling 2d6 with no modifiers. The DM does not tell the player what their DC is.  

On the turn a player is downed and on every subsequent turn, the player rolls a death check and tells the DM their roll. If their roll matches or passes the DC it's a success. If the roll is below the DC, it's a failure. If the roll is a failure, the DM notes by how much the roll failed, DC - roll. This difference will be used to determine the consequence of the failure using the consequence table. Don't make any extra rolls to resolve consequences at this point as other characters might use medicine to improve the outcome, skills might be triggered, etc. Consequences are only resolved if/when the character survives.

3 successes means the character stabilizes at their current HP. 3 failures means they die.

Once they either hit 3 successes or 3 failures, the DM tells them to stop rolling. Th
