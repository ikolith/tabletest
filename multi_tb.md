The framework for setting a DC for a given social roll and the framework for reputation management are the same and they can be used in combination. Both systems share the same table of scores with rough characterizations of what each score "feels" like.

The scores range from -6 ("Reviled") to +6 ("Revered"). These scores can be used by a DM to easily keep track of relationships and attitudes. They are also mechanical modifiers. If a character is at -2 ("Strongly Disliked") with some group or individual, you treat their social roll as lowered by 2 (or you can just raise the DC by 2).  

You can use these scores to set a sort of "default" attitude or bias for NPCs. The kindly innkeeper in a small peaceful town might treat every new person at around +2 ("Well-Liked"). The sneering guards in front of a keep might treat everyone at -2 ("Strongly Disliked"). Another traveler on the road just trying to get to where they're going might be at -1 ("Disliked") just because they really don't want to stop and chat. The same traveler might, if you help them out, switch to +1 ("Liked").  

The purpose of social rolls is to be able to, in a given interaction, change the way people perceive you or interact with you. Remember that rolling checks with the SOCIAL score does not replace the content of what a character does but just augments it. If a player passes the DC, treat their interaction as happening at 1 point higher than it would be otherwise. If the player exceeds the DC by more than 3, you can treat the interaction as being at 2 points higher than it would be otherwise.

d the DM sets a death DC by rolling 2d6 with no modifiers. The DM does not tell the player what their DC is.  

On the turn a player is downed and on every subsequent turn, the player rolls a death check and tells the DM their roll. If their roll matches or passes the DC it's a success. If the roll is below the DC, it's a failure. If the roll is a failure, the DM notes by how much the roll failed, DC - roll. This difference will be used to determine the consequence of the failure using the consequence table. Don't make any extra rolls to resolve consequences at this point as other characters might use medicine to improve the outcome, skills might be triggered, etc. Consequences are only resolved if/when the character survives.

3 successes means the character stabilizes at their current HP. 3 failures means they die.

Once they either hit 3 successes or 3 failures, the DM tells them to stop rolling. Th
